def complement_rgb(rgb):
    """
    Returns the complement of color rgb.
    
    Parameter rgb: the color to complement
    Precondition: rgb is an RGB object

def str5(value):
    """
    Returns value as a string, but expanded or rounded to be exactly 5 characters.
    
    The decimal point counts as one of the five characters.
   
    Examples:
        str5(1.3546)  is  '1.355'.
        str5(21.9954) is  '22.00'.
        str5(21.994)  is  '21.99'.
        str5(130.59)  is  '130.6'.
        str5(130.54)  is  '130.5'.
        str5(1)       is  '1.000'.
    
    Parameter value: the number to conver to a 5 character string.
    Precondition: value is a number (int or float), 0 <= value <= 360.
    """
    # Remember that the rounding takes place at a different place depending 
    # on how big value is. Look at the examples in the specification.

def str5_cmyk(cmyk):

    Returns the string representation of cmyk in the form "(C, M, Y, K)".
    
    In the output, each of C, M, Y, and K should be exactly 5 characters long.
    Hence the output of this function is not the same as str(cmyk)
    
    Example: if str(cmyk) is 
    
          '(0.0,31.3725490196,31.3725490196,0.0)'
    
    then str5_cmyk(cmyk) is '(0.000, 31.37, 31.37, 0.000)'. Note the spaces 
    after the commas. These must be there.
    
    Parameter cmyk: the color to convert to a string
    Precondition: cmyk is an CMYK object.

    """
    Returns the string representation of hsv in the form "(H, S, V)".
    
    In the output, each of H, S, and V should be exactly 5 characters long.
    Hence the output of this function is not the same as str(hsv)
    
    Example: if str(hsv) is 
    
          '(0.0,0.313725490196,1.0)'
    
    then str5_hsv(hsv) is '(0.000, 0.314, 1.000)'. Note the spaces after the

    Returns value adjusted to the "sawtooth curve" for the given contrast
    
    At contrast = 0.5, the curve is the normal line y = x, so value is 
    unaffected. If contrast < 0.5, values are pulled closer together, with all 
    values collapsing to 0.5 when contrast = 0. If contrast > 0, the values are 
    pulled farther apart, with all values becoming 0 or 1 when contrast = 1.
